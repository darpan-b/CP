Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree is a data structure that is used for basically same stuff as segment tree. 
Fenwick tree takes O(n) memory (no extra constant factor involved), and does both update and query operations in O(log n) time.

Further notes are written considering the opertation f(l,r) = sum of elements in the range [l,r].

Each node, k of the BIT stores sum of elements of size 2^x for some x <= k

For the update operation, we start from the given node, and move until the last index, each time flipping the last unset bit.
For the query operation, we start from the given node, and move till the first index, each time unsetting all trailing set bits.
If you find it difficult to understand what this means, look up the portion "Definition of g(i)" here: https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/fenwick.html
