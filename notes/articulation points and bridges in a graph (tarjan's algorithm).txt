Articulation point and Bridges in a graph
-------------------------------------------

Q.  What is an articulation point and what is a bridge ?

S.  An articulation point in a graph is a vertex, which when removed from the graph, increases the number of connected components in the graph.
    Similarly, a bridge is an edge which when removed from the graph, increases the number of connected components in it.

Q.  How to find articulation points and bridges in a graph ? 
S.  Artculation points in a graph can be detected by Tarjan's algorithm.

Tarjan's algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run a DFS from any arbitrary vertex. Maintain low[u] which stores the lowest possible entry time of a node that can be reached
from node u, and disc[u] which stores the discovery time for each node u. Entry time for the node can be kept track of by using
a global/static variable. When some node u is visited during the DFS traversal, for all adjacent unvisited vertices v of u, run
DFS for them and update low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]). Also maintain the count of children in the DFS tree of u. u is an
articulation point if one of the following conditions hold:
1. low[v] >= disc[u] for some v in the DFS tree of u
   For bridges, this is the only change in the algorithm:
   if low[v] > disc[u], then the edge {u,v} is a bridge
2. u is the root of the DFS tree and it has 2 or more children.
For all adjacent visited vertices w of u, update low[u] = min(low[u], disc[w])
We don't do low[u] = min(low[u], low[w]) as it will not detect cycles for which u is a root, and thus is an articulation point.
